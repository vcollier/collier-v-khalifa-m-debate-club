		<h2>Hip Hop Sucks</h2>
		<p>I'm not a big fan of hip hop. It is not something I really enjoy listenning to. <br>Of course I may end up liking some songs after hearing them frequently. <br>The reason for that is I can't distingush the individual sounds of musical instruments. <br>I love to be able to hear the sound of the guitar, the the piano, voilins, electric guitar, or whatever instrument  <br>In hip hop, it's like a repeating rythym that is mosly drums and unknwon sounds produced electronically, that do not resemble any known instruments. <br>I don't like that artificial music. I really love music to be loud and fast like hard rock. I also like soft and slow sometimes. <br>But I love to be able to hear the instruments and the vocals of the singer clearly. To me, that is good music.</p>
