	<h1>Hip Hop, Yay or Nay?</h1>

		<h2>Hip Hop Rocks!</h2>
		<p>Everyone like different music genres for different reasons. Generally, we tend to lean towards<br>the type of music that makes us feel strong emotions or music we just want to jam out to. Hip<br> hop fills both of these voids. Strong poetry and real-life experiences draws the listener in, relating<br>to the lyrics. However, the beautiful lyrics aren't the only thing that makes hip hop the best genre.<br> With these lyrics come catchy beats and music composition that makes you want to dance. To<br>support this evidence, we need an example. The example aritist we will discuss today is the one<br>and only Drake. Drake is a Canadian Hip hop artist born and raised in Toronto. Almost all of his<br> songs talk about his past, and his present and how they effect one another. Drake is a popular artist<br> in the United States, but an even more popular artist here in Canada. A lot of his songs contain<br> information and stories from Canada, drawing in the listeners who can relate. Most recently, Drake<br>came out with his music video for 'I'm Upset', following his around 'Degrassi High' form the<br> popular Canadian TV show Degrassi. This brought a lot of attention from old fans of the show. In <br>cuonclusion, Hip hop reaches into the hearts and souls of its listeners and pulls at the heart strings. <br>Hip hop rocks!</p>

		<h2>Hip Hop Sucks</h2>
		<p>I'm not a big fan of hip hop. It is not something I really enjoy listenning to. <br>Of course I may end up liking some songs after hearing them frequently. <br>The reason for that is I can't distingush the individual sounds of musical instruments. <br>I love to be able to hear the sound of the guitar, the the piano, voilins, electric guitar, or whatever instrument  <br>In hip hop, it's like a repeating rythym that is mosly drums and unknwon sounds produced electronically, that do not resemble any known instruments. <br>I don't like that artificial music. I really love music to be loud and fast like hard rock. I also like soft and slow sometimes. <br>But I love to be able to hear the instruments and the vocals of the singer clearly. To me, that is great music.</p>
